Hello everyone, I’m @FPUT-1953 a student of Physics who loves coding! My name, FPUT-1953, refers to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou experiment done in 1953, which was the first experiment of computational physics!

I know how to code in C++ and Python, and I know a bit of FORTRAN90, but I hope that one day I will learn other codes!
